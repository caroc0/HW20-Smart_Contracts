# HW 20 Smart Contracts

![contract](Images/smart-contract.png)

## Objective

Build smart contracts to automate some company finances to make everyone's lives easier, increase transparency, and to make accounting and auditing practically automatic.

**Level One** is an `AssociateProfitSplitter` contract. This will accept Ether into the contract and divide the Ether evenly among the associate level employees. This will allow the Human Resources department to pay employees quickly and efficiently.


### Contract requirements


At the top of your contract, you will need to define the following `public` variables:

* `employee_one` -- The `address` of the first employee. Make sure to set this to `payable`.

* `employee_two` -- Another `address payable` that represents the second employee.

* `employee_three` -- The third `address payable` that represents the third employee.

Create a constructor function that accepts:

* `address payable _one`

* `address payable _two`

* `address payable _three`

Within the constructor, set the employee addresses to equal the parameter values. This will allow you to avoid hardcoding the employee addresses.

Next, create the following functions:

* `balance` -- This function should be set to `public view returns(uint)`, and must return the contract's current balance. Since we should always be sending Ether to the beneficiaries, this function should always return `0`. If it does not, the `deposit` function is not handling the remainders properly and should be fixed. This will serve as a test function of sorts.

* `deposit` -- This function should set to `public payable` check, ensuring that only the owner can call the function.

  * In this function, perform the following steps:

    * Set a `uint amount` to equal `msg.value / 3;` in order to calculate the split value of the Ether.

    * Transfer the `amount` to `employee_one`.

    * Repeat the steps for `employee_two` and `employee_three`.

    * Since `uint` only contains positive whole numbers, and Solidity does not fully support float/decimals, we must deal with a potential remainder at the end of this function since `amount` will discard the remainder during division.

    * We may either have `1` or `2` wei leftover, so transfer the `msg.value - amount * 3` back to `msg.sender`. This will re-multiply the `amount` by 3, then subtract it from the `msg.value` to account for any leftover wei, and send it back to Human Resources.

* Create a fallback function using `function() external payable`, and call the `deposit` function from within it. This will ensure that the logic in `deposit` executes if Ether is sent directly to the contract. This is important to prevent Ether from being locked in the contract since we don't have a `withdraw` function in this use-case.

#### Testing the contract
